# BitGen-tyaftelka
This program was made by Anarb and it generates Bitcoin by searching multiple possible
wallet combinations until it's finds one with over 0 BTC and saves it into
a file called "wet.txt" in the results folder.
It's recommended to leave this running for a long time to get the best resaults, It's doesn't use up
that much resources so you can leave it in the background in the chance of you hitting a jackpot.
It's like mining but with less resources
